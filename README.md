# Web Design 

Assignment for CMD Webdesign

## Resit #1

| Feedback        | Solution          |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Link to `'opdracht 1'` doesn't work | Changed the link |
| Story for the user isn't finished | Added a clear description of what the user scenario is about |
| The flow is not clear (because story was not finished) | Added `'call to action'` buttons to show my people what to do |
| No inclusive design | It has inclusive design for both users (added in the readme a description) |

## Resit #2

| Feedback        | Solution          |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| No clear style for sign-up links | Changed the link to a button |
| Can't see changing from page | Added a clear description of what the user scenario is about |
| Link names doesn't match their page | Changed the links, their text, their path and their order  |
| Not the right flow for the website | Euhm... Yep | 

In the end I changed the flow of the website for the last feedback. After a good discussion I changed the things I knew could be better. I changed the flow a little bit so the student gets a way to check his/her niveau in webdevelopment.
